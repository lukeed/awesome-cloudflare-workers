# Awesome Cloudflare Workers

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome articles & code for **[Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)**.  They are similar to* [browsers' Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API), running in a modified Chromium 'tab', but in the cloud--flare.

Inspired by the [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) list.  (A bit different, since the [CSV bookmark dump](https://github.com/tomByrer/awesome-cloudflare-workers/blob/master/cloudflare-workers-bookmarks.csv#L1) contains *many* other links that didn't make the 'awesome' list.)

The "Emergency-management" links are for projects that help out with COVID-19 and other emgerinces.  "Boss" links are top examples to help convince others (namely your boss or CTO).

Please use the [Link Suggestion Form](https://airtable.com/shryEZ28iLgjBbTCE) to add an URL to this list.  To fix something, suggest a new catgory, tag, etc, reach me on Twitter.
